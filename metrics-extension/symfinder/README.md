# Symfinder

Symfinder is a toolchain parsing a single Java codebase to identify potential variability implementations.
The output of symfinder consists in an object containing information on the presence of variability implementations in the analysed codebase (e.g. if a class has been identified as a variation point or a variant, number of variants of an identified variation pointâ€¦).
